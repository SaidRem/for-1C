This directory is designed for storing and organizing scripts and handlers written in the 1C
language specifically for 1C enterprise systems. These scripts, also known as "processing files"
(обработки), are designed to extend the functionality of 1C configurations, automate tasks, and
implement custom solutions tailored to business processes.

Each script in this directory should:
    - be compatible with the 1C platform;
    - follow the standardized naming conversions for easy identification;
    - include documentation or comments explaining its purpose and usage.

The content of this directory will support 1C users and developers in enhancing and customizing
their 1C systems, streamlining workflows, ensuring effective management of 1C enterprise
applications.
